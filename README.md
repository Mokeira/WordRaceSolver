# Word Race Solver

[Letroca Word Race](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.fanatee.wordrace&hl=en_US) is one of my favorite mobile word race games and is the inspiration for this project. In a word race, the player has a few seconds to unscramble the jumbled words as they try to score more points than their opponent.

## Next steps
+ Validate words before returning them to the user
